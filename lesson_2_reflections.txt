What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do 
it?

It creates a folder named ".git" where all our metadata will be 
stored, we need it to create our repository and be able to use 
version.control tools.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the 
repository?

Working directory contains all the files in the folder, but maybe 
for some reason, we do not want to keep track of certain files, so 
we choose just the ones we want to keep under version control and 
send them to the staging area.

What value do you think it offers?

It allows us to define exactly what files we want to keep track of, 
before making a commit.

per logical
